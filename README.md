## PersonDetail collation and simple storage in array

This was intended to be a simple registration program in which people delivered their individual details which include 
1. Name
2. age
3. gender
And for each person put in, a universal counter was assigning an id to differ.
I planned on putting time outputs to check when a person entered and the people that entered in a time frame or under a specific age range.
**TO USE THIS**
1. install cargo/ rust on your windows or ubuntu or mac , you can get all installation files from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. clone the file to your device by following the instructions and run cargo run

### There are no extra dependencies as i did not want to make it too complex. 

I would use some of all of what is in my repo for a big final showdown :)

**WAGMI AND HAPPY CODING,** may the coding gods be with you all :)
